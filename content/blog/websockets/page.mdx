# Understanding WebSockets: The Backbone of Real-Time Communication

In today’s fast-paced digital world, users expect **instant feedback** — from chatting with friends to seeing live sports scores or stock prices update in real time. Traditional web technologies like HTTP struggle to meet these expectations efficiently. This is where **WebSockets** come in.

WebSockets provide a way to establish a **persistent**, **full-duplex communication channel** between the client (such as a browser) and the server. This enables both sides to send data to each other instantly — without needing to constantly refresh or re-request information.

## 🧠 What Are WebSockets?

WebSockets are a **communication protocol** built on top of TCP that allows **real-time, two-way interaction** between a client and a server.

Unlike HTTP — which is **request-response-based** — WebSockets stay open once the connection is established. Both client and server can push messages to each other at any time.

Let’s break that down:

- **Full-duplex:** Both sides can send and receive data simultaneously.  
- **Persistent:** One connection stays alive for as long as needed.  
- **Low latency:** No repetitive handshakes or reconnections.  

This makes WebSockets perfect for scenarios that demand **instant updates**, like chat systems, live dashboards, or collaborative tools.

## 🔁 Why Not Just Use HTTP?

Before WebSockets, developers relied on creative but inefficient methods to simulate real-time communication:

### 1. Polling

The client repeatedly sends HTTP requests every few seconds to check for updates.

```js
setInterval(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/updates");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}, 3000);
